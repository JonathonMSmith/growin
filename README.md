#Overview

The ionospheric Rayleigh-Taylor instability flux-tube-integrated linear growth rate 
(IRFL) is often used in the study of equatorial spread F(ESF).
The Rayleigh-Taylor instability is often accepted as the mechanism responsible
for ESF, therefore a computation of its growth rate is valuable. This package
includes many common approximations used in the computation of the 
Rayleigh-Taylor growth rate (RTgr).
