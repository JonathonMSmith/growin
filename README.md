#Overview

The flux-tube-integrated linear Rayleigh-Taylor instability (grow)th rate of 
(i)o(n)ospheric irregularities is often used in the study of equatorial spread 
F(ESF). The Rayleigh-Taylor instability is often accepted as the mechanism
responsible for ESF, therefore a computation of its growth rate is valuable. 
This package includes many common approximations used in the computation of the 
Rayleigh-Taylor growth rate.

#Installation

Coming Soon...
In the meantime:
Clone the repo and run the following command as usual.

```
    python setup.py install
```
